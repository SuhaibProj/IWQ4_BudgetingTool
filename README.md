# IWQ4_BudgetingTool

# Getting an Intellij IDEA free trial
Go to 'https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/' where there is an option for a 30 day free trial of the premium version of Intellij. Click the download option and install the downloaded package.

Once you load up the App, it will take you to a license activation screen. There should be an option to start a free trial. Do this and you should be in.

# Loading the project and using git in Intellij
Once you've cloned the github repo (git clone https://github.com/SuhaibProj/IWQ4_BudgetingTool.git in your terminal), you can go to File -> Open and search for the folder. 

There should be a 'git' option at the bottom set of tabs within the app. Open this out and right click on the local master branch, and you can create a new branch for you to work on alongside the current master copy.
